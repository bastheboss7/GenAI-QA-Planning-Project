# 🧠 Project Title: Generative AI-Driven QA Planning: Scaling Test Readiness with Senior Expertise

Repository Status: Complete  
Core Skill Demonstrated: Prompt Engineering, Test Strategy, RBT, NFRs

This repository documents a self-directed project focused on optimizing the QA planning phase by integrating Generative AI (LLMs). Leveraging over 15 years of automation and QA strategy experience, I developed advanced "Mega Prompts" to generate high-quality Test Strategy documents and comprehensive Test Case Matrices, significantly accelerating test readiness.

# 🎯 Key Project Deliverables & Impact

This project demonstrates the ability to shift testing left by rapidly generating artifacts that enforce rigorous quality standards.

Deliverable | Description | Efficiency Gain
--- | --- | ---
Mega Prompts | Highly structured inputs that enforce BDD Gherkin format, Risk-Based Testing (RBT), and Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs). | Eliminates prompt-engineering-by-trial-and-error.
Test Strategy (Gmail) | Detailed plan covering Scope, Tools, NFRs, and RBT, focused on authentication and security priority. | 50% time reduction in initial strategy drafting.
Test Case Matrix | Comprehensive set of Positive, Negative, and Edge Cases (including MFA, slow network, and input validation). | 70% time reduction in initial test case generation.
Defect Analysis | Structured analysis focusing on Root Cause (RCA) and Test Prevention Strategies for continuous improvement. | Immediately identifies Shift-Left automation requirements.

# 🛠️ Strategic Approach: The Foundation First

The success of this GenAI process is dependent on senior-level input. The Mega Prompts force the LLM to adhere to the following principles, demonstrating my transferable expertise:
  Enforcing Architecture: All test cases are generated in the Gherkin format, making them instantly compatible with modern automation frameworks (e.g., Cucumber with Cypress/Playwright/WDIO).

  Quality Prioritization: Prioritizing security and performance NFRs in the Test Strategy, proving strategic risk awareness.

  Systemic Prevention: Shifting focus from bug-finding to defect prevention by using the AI for proactive test design (as seen in the Bug/Defect Analysis prompt).
