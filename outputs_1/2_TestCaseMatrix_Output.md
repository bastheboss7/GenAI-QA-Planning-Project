📝 Gmail Login Functionality Test Case MatrixThis matrix provides detailed test cases for the Gmail login functionality, categorized by positive, negative, and edge scenarios, and structured using the Gherkin format (Given/When/Then) for clear execution and validation.1. Positive Cases (Happy Path & Convenience)Test IDCategoryTest Case TitleGherkin Steps (Given/When/Then)Expected ResultLGN-P-001Happy PathSuccessful Standard Login with Valid CredentialsGiven the user is on the Gmail login page.When the user enters a valid registered email and correct password, and submits the form.Then the user is successfully redirected to the Inbox, and a secure session token is issued.Successful redirect to Inbox (HTTP 200) and display of user mail content.LGN-P-002Happy PathSuccessful Login with MFA (TOTP)Given the user has a valid account with TOTP-based MFA enabled.When the user enters the correct primary credentials, and subsequently enters the correct TOTP code.Then the user is successfully granted access to the Inbox.Successful validation of the TOTP code and redirection to the Inbox.LGN-P-003Convenience"Remember Me" Session PersistenceGiven the user checks the "Remember Me" option during a successful login.When the user closes the browser and then re-opens the login page after 1 hour.Then the user is either automatically logged in or has their email pre-filled and remains logged in without requiring the password.Session is automatically resumed, bypassing the credential entry screen.2. Negative Cases (Input Validation & Basic Security)Test IDCategoryTest Case TitleGherkin Steps (Given/When/Then)Expected ResultLGN-N-001Input ValidationInvalid Email Format (Missing '@')Given the user is on the Gmail login page.When the user enters an email address missing the "@" symbol (e.g., userdomain.com) and proceeds.Then an immediate, client-side error message is displayed stating "Enter a valid email address".Clear error message displayed before server submission, and the user remains on the login screen.LGN-N-002Input ValidationNon-Registered Email AttemptGiven the user is on the Gmail login page.When the user enters an email address that is not registered in the system.Then the system displays a message indicating "Could not find your Google Account" or similar.A clear, non-specific error message prevents account enumeration.LGN-N-003Security (Brute Force)Repeated Incorrect Password Attempts (3 attempts)Given the user has a valid registered email.When the user enters the correct email but submits an incorrect password 3 consecutive times.Then the system immediately displays a warning message and presents a CAPTCHA or imposes a temporary rate limit (e.g., 30-second wait) on subsequent login attempts for that account/IP.Rate limiting/CAPTCHA displayed on the 4th attempt to prevent brute force.3. Edge Cases (Session Management & Resilience)Test IDCategoryTest Case TitleGherkin Steps (Given/When/Then)Expected ResultLGN-E-001ResilienceLogin with Saved Credentials on Slow NetworkGiven the user's device has login credentials saved and is connected to a simulated 3G (slow) network (high latency/low bandwidth).When the user clicks the login button.Then the system processes the request successfully, displaying a loading state, and logs the user in within the defined Performance SLA (e.g., < 5.0s on 3G).Successful login completion, ensuring the request does not time out and gracefully handles the delay.LGN-E-002Security (MFA Bypass)Stale Session Token Usage after LogoutGiven the user successfully logs in, a session token is generated, and the user then explicitly logs out.When an attacker attempts to reuse the previously valid but now stale session token to access the Inbox or bypass the MFA prompt.Then the system immediately invalidates the token, rejects the request, and forces the user back to the primary login page.Session token is rejected, returning an authentication required error (HTTP 401).LGN-E-003Security (Account Lockout)System-Wide Account LockoutGiven a valid account has been subjected to 10 consecutive failed login attempts (crossing the lockout threshold).When the account owner attempts to log in with the correct credentials.Then the system displays a message stating "Account temporarily locked due to excessive failed attempts," preventing login until the defined lockout period expires (e.g., 1 hour).Account remains inaccessible, even with correct credentials, until the lockout period is over or a password reset is initiated.
